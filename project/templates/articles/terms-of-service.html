    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 7, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to our web app! By accessing or using this site, you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>
        Our platform allows users to create and share interactive visual diagrams, such as Venn diagrams (with 2 to 4 sets) and quadrant diagrams (such as a politcal compass). These diagrams can be customized with your own labels, axis titles, intersection definitions and colors. Users can invite others to participate by positioning options (these options could represent friends or group members, or a common set of interests, opinions or any listable subject) on the diagram anonymously.
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
        You are solely responsible for the content you create, share, and interact with on this platform. This includes any diagrams you build, any labels, options or names you input, and any placements you submit. You must ensure that your use of the service complies with all applicable laws and respects the dignity and privacy of others.
    </p>

    <h2>3. No Liability for Content or Results</h2>
    <p>
        We provide a platform for creative and social interaction. As such, we do not moderate, control, or endorse any specific content or results created by users. The diagrams, placements, and results are entirely user-generated.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree that we are not liable for any emotional, social, reputational, or professional impact caused by the content, placements, or results produced with our app — including but not limited to feedback, scores, or classifications generated by your group or community.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you choose to participate in or share content through our app, you do so at your own discretion and risk.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Anonymity and Participation</h2>
    <p>
        While users are required to verify their identity to participate, all submissions remain anonymous. Diagram owners may view the list of verified participants but cannot see who submitted which placement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each shared diagram includes a unique link. Only users with access to that link and who verify their email can participate or view results.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p>You may not use the service to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Harass, abuse, or target individuals with harmful content;</li>
        <li>Create or distribute defamatory, hateful, or unlawful material;</li>
        <li>Bypass verification or attempt to manipulate anonymity protections;</li>
        <li>Reverse-engineer or disrupt the platform in any way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Account Verification</h2>
    <p>
        Verification is required to participate in diagrams. This may be done through trusted third parties (Google, Facebook, Discord) or a code-based system. We do not store social login data beyond your verified email address.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
        The platform, including its code, design, and default templates, is owned by the developers. However, user-generated content (your diagrams, labels, names, etc.) remains your own.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using the service, you grant us a non-exclusive license to host and display your submitted content as necessary for the platform’s functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the platform for users who violate these Terms or misuse the service. In such cases, related content may also be removed.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
        The service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. We make no guarantees regarding availability, accuracy of results, or suitability for any purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be held liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the platform. This includes but is not limited to emotional harm, group disputes, or misinterpretation of results.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We may update these Terms at any time. Changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of any changes.
    </p>
