    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 7, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our web app to create and share customized diagrams with others.</p>

    <h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following information from users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email verification data:</strong> Collected through Google, Facebook, Discord, or a code-based verification system.</li>
        <li><strong>User-submitted content:</strong> This includes your projects and their metadata (such as category names and section names), along with any associated options.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous entry data:</strong> All submissions you make on your own or others' diagrams, including placement data and your email address, which remains unlinkable to submission details for everyone, including the chart creator. The creator of the diagram can see your email address after your participated, but not link it to your submission.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You have the right to request deletion of your data. Once requested, your data will be permanently removed from our systems after 15 days. This waiting period is mandatory to comply with possible legal requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide a functional and interactive experience within the app.</li>
        <li>To ensure fair participation through verified access.</li>
        <li>To generate aggregated results for diagrams. Your submission data is anonymized and viewable by all participants. The diagram owner can see which users participated, but cannot link identities to specific submissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Anonymity</h2>
    <p>
        All final chart submissions are anonymized. While users must verify their identity to participate, submitted data is never tied to an identifiable user. You can search for an entry to see how it was placed, but not who placed it. Diagram creators can see a list of participants, but not their corresponding input data.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Shareable Links</h2>
    <p>
        Each chart has a unique, shareable link. Anyone with the link may view or participate, provided they verify their email. Only verified participants can submit responses or view the final results.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
    <p>
        We only use essential cookies for session management and authentication. We do not use third-party trackers or behavioral profiling tools.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We may use third-party providers such as Google, Facebook, or Discord for account verification. These services have their own privacy policies. We only access and store your verified email address â€” no other social login data is retained.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain anonymized chart submissions and email verification data only as long as necessary to maintain chart functionality. You may request deletion of your charts or submission data at any time by visiting your <a href="/app">profile</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        This app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When updates occur, the "Last updated" date at the top of the page will reflect the changes. Continued use of the app after such updates indicates your acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>
        For any questions or data-related requests, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kipteammm@gmail.com">kipteammm@gmail.com</a>.
