    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 3, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our web app to create and share customized Venn diagrams or political compass charts with friends.</p>

    <h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following information from users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email verification data:</strong> Either via Google, Facebook, or a code-based verification system.</li>
        <li><strong>User-submitted names:</strong> Names you input (e.g., friends) as options for chart placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous chart data:</strong> The final placement of options on your diagram. This is stored without linking to personal identities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide a personalized and interactive chart experience.</li>
        <li>To ensure fair participation via verified access.</li>
        <li>To aggregate anonymous input into group results (e.g., median placements).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Anonymity</h2>
    <p>
        All final chart submissions are anonymized. Even though users must verify their identity to participate, we do not associate chart input with identifiable users. You can search for a name to see where it landed, but not who placed it there.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Shareable Links</h2>
    <p>
        Each chart session generates a unique shareable link. Anyone with the link can view or participate, provided they verify their email. Only participants who have verified can submit inputs.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cookies & Tracking</h2>
    <p>
        We use minimal cookies necessary for session management and authentication. No third-party ad tracking or behavioral profiling is in use.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We may use third-party providers like Google or Facebook for account verification. These services have their own privacy policies, and we do not access or store your social login data beyond the verified email address.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain anonymized chart submissions and email verifications only for the duration necessary to keep your chart accessible. You can request deletion of your chart or submission data at any time by contacting us.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        This app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, the "Last updated" date at the top of the page will be revised. Continued use of the app indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>
        For any questions or requests regarding your data, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@yourappdomain.com">privacy@yourappdomain.com</a>
